# First Post

Similarly to the classic "first commit", this is my all time first blog post, which I will keep really short.
<br>

#### Blog's scope

In this blog I will be posting (hopefully) interesting news and information related to Web Development with JavaScript. But not exclusively. I will also try to cover topics related to Linux, IoT, DevOps, Cybersecurity and other cool Tech stuff. <br>
In other words, my aim is to keep track of and put together all the small projects and ideas I will be working on and learning.
<br>

#### About this Blog

This blog runs on [`Hexo`](https://hexo.io/) - "A fast, simple & powerful blog framework", as the project describes itself. <br>
It enables anyone to create static websites in a breeze, without any backend and complex Databases.

But there's more. Putting Hexo and [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com)  to work together, you can also easily deploy and host your static website in just a couple command lines. 

If your code is hosted on a public GitHub repository it even doesn't cost you a penny. Thanks, GitHub!
<br>

#### What's coming next
In my next post I will explain how to create such a blog, then host in using GitHub Pages and point your own domain to it and configuring a cool CDN, [`Cloudflare`](https://www.cloudflare.com/), which has some perks. 
<br>

So see you back soon. Stay tuned!
