##### About

In this blog I will be posting (hopefully) interesting news and information related to Web Development with JavaScript. But not exclusively. I will also try to cover topics related to Linux, IoT, DevOps, Cybersecurity and other cool Tech stuff. <br>
In other words, my aim is to keep track of and put together all the small projects and ideas I will be working on and learning.
<br><br>
I will be more than happy to receive feedback and join constructive discussions.
